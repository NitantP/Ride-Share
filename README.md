# Ride Share

Ride Share is an application developed to facilitate carpooling. Users can offer a ride (and earn money) or request a ride. Ride Share matches up offerers and requesters to make it easy. Users are able to track their statistics, earnings, and message other users.

## Built With

* [JSP](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/jsp/index.html) - Used to build pages
* [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) - Used to host database
* [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) - Used to host virtual server
* [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/index.html) - Used to deploy application
* [JDBC](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdbc/index.html) - Accessing database via JSP
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - Relational database management system

## NOTE

Unfortuneately, because the trial period for Amazon Web Services ended for the account that controlled the RDS and EC2 instances, Ride Share is no longer usable. Usually Ride Share would be available over the internet thanks to Apache Tomcat and EC2, but this is no longer the case. Furthermore, downloading the files to use would not work as is either because the database (RDS) no longer exists. Sorry!
